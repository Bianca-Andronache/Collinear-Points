# Collinear-Points

## Problem:

There are 3 sets of points in the plane

A = {A1, A2,..., An} -> The points of A are on the equation line y = 0

B = {B1, B2,..., Bn} -> The points of B are on the equation line y = 1

C = {C1, C2,..., Cn} -> The points of C are on the equation line y = 2

Determine if there is a pair of collinear points Ai, Bj, Ck

## Reformulation of the problem:

There are 3 sets of numbers

A = {a1, a2,..., an}

B = {b1, b2,..., bn}

C = {c1, c2,..., cn}

Determine if there is a pair of numbers ai, bj, ck with the property: 2bj = ai + ck
