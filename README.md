# Collinear-Points

There are 3 sets of points in the plane
    A = {A1, A2,..., An}
    B = {B1, B2,..., Bn}
    C = {C1, C2,..., Cn}
  The points of A are on the equation line y = 0
  The points of B are on the equation line y = 1
  The points of C are on the equation line y = 2
  Determine if there is a pair of collinear points Ai, Bj, Ck
  
  Reformulation of the problem:
  There are 3 sets of numbers
    A = {a1, a2,..., an}
    B = {b1, b2,..., bn}
    C = {c1, c2,..., cn}
  Determine if there is a pair of numbers ai, bj, ck with the property: 2*bj = ai + ck
